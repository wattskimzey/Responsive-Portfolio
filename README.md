# Responsive-Portfolio
This was just a royal pain.  I never finished it the first time, then when I went back to redo it, i ended up nesting a repo within another.  When I tried to delete everything, that led into an abyss of googling trying to figure out how to kill processes so i could delete my original repo, then reclone the new repo at github.  Oh. My. Gosh.
